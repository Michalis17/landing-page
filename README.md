## Installation

You will need to download the landing page folder and open within the folder the index.html file to begin using the landing page.

## Functionality of Landing Page

The navigation menu is dynamically created based on the sections on the page.

The navigation menu links allow the user to scroll to the desired section on the page. In addition the default event of the anchor link has been disabled.

The user is able to distinguish each section in view as they scroll.

When the user scrolls down a button will appear that will take them to the top of the page.

## Development

This landing page was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This means the projects dependencies are the styles.css file and the app.js file.

Without these files the HTML page would not look or function how it should be.
